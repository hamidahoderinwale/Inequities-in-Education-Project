		<h2>ðŸ‘‹Â Welcome, to the site!</h2>
    <br> 
		<p>There are a variety of factors, that impact the sentiments of a country's habitants towards education, in the modern-day
			and age, social media personalities, major world events and the rapid spread of information through a variety of mediums
			have caused major changes in what a new generation of Canadians are interested in studying. Education is a fundamental
			pillar in a nation's productivity and growth - by studying education, we are able to make better decisions and forecast
			the professional outcomes of future generations. </p>
		<p>In the multi-component analysis, we will visually represent our data insights in combination with written analysis to
			explore any conclusions and explain the data visualizations. </p>

		The expected outcome of the project is to help young Canadians understand the shifts in education so they can better prepare
		for their future and for older people in the form of faculty at post-secondary institutions, parents of young people and
		even corporate employers, to best understand how to support students. Education is exceptionally important however with
		rising tuition costs, it is important to understand whether the time and monetary investment are worth it. As a student-led
		investigatory data project, this was an opportunity to better understand the Canadian education landscape on a better level
		to better prepare for our future.

    <br>
    The datasets analyzed focused on undergraduate education because we felt this was the most applicable level of study that would allow for the greatest benefit amongst readers and the public who came across our research. In the future, we are hopeful that we will be able to highlight other groups of people and other components of the educational system for deeper analysis.
